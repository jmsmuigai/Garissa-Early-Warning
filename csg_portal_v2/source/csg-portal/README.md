# Garissa County Steering Group (CSG) – Smart Early-Warning & Coordination Portal

A trilingual (English · Kiswahili · Af-Soomaali), map-first web portal for the Garissa County Steering Group:
El Niño 2026 flood early warning, River Tana / Seven Forks forecasting, "Am I at risk?" location checks,
health & WASH risk, nature-based solutions, community map-making, the County Partnerships & Coordination
Policy, and two-way emergency reporting – with a Gemini-powered GeoAI assistant that drives the map.

*Web portal powered by the County Government of Garissa, Directorate of ICT & GIS – james.mukoma@garissa.go.ke*

## Quick start

| You have | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Mac** | Double-click `start_portal.command` (first run installs everything, then opens http://localhost:8080) |
| **Windows** | Double-click `start_portal.bat` |
| **Just a browser** | Open `frontend/dist/index.html` through any static web server (e.g. `cd frontend/dist && python3 -m http.server 8080`). Everything works except the Gemini assistant, AI translation and server-side report storage. |

Requirements: Python 3.10+ and (only to rebuild the site) Node.js 20+.

Enable the AI features by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and setting `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

## What is inside

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Risk map** (home) | Google Hybrid / Satellite / OSM / Esri / Topo / dark basemaps; 30+ toggleable layers (county boundary in bright red, sub-counties, River Tana, 0.5–5 km Tana buffers with asset counts, UNOSAT 2023–24 flood extents, flood simulator 3.0–7.5 m, laghas by flash-flood hazard, Tana "blind folds", schools, health facilities, boreholes, water pans, Dadaab camps, KMD stations, Seven Forks dams and catchment, flood-wave travel markers, NBS sites, SRTM elevation, LUC2010 & ESA WorldCover land use, WorldPop density, live NASA IMERG rain); compass, legend, scale, coordinates, hover/click attributes, flood-wave animation, River Tana staff gauge, buffer tool, fullscreen. |
| **Am I at risk?** | GPS, place search, coordinates or tap-the-map → HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW verdict from past flood extents, flood-simulation stage, distance to the Tana and laghas, land cover; nearest 5 schools and 5 health facilities with directions; sources cited. Also answerable from the chat assistant ("Is Saka at risk?"). |
| **El Niño warning** | Model showdown (ECMWF, US-AI, GFS, AI-ECMWF, KMD) and the Director's 700 mm scenario; Python Monte-Carlo ensemble with exceedance odds; live Open-Meteo multi-model charts; Tana stage forecast with Masinga fill slider; OND outlook; sub-county impacts. |
| **Tana & Seven Forks** | Dam cascade with fill/spill, flood-wave travel times Kiambere → Garissa (36–48 h) → Delta (96–120 h), gauge forecast against CSG thresholds (4.0 / 5.0 / 6.2 m). |
| **Health & WASH** | Disease risk calendar (AWD, cholera, typhoid, leptospirosis, dengue, chikungunya, RVF, malaria, skin, snakebite) under three rainfall scenarios, peak dates, hotspots, mitigation, facilities at risk, evidence. |
| **Nature-based solutions** | 76 screened sites in six families, site finder that flies the map, implementation steps, open-science links. |
| **Community maps** | Plain-language query ("schools within 2 km of the Tana in Fafi"), filters, results table and a print-ready colour map composer (title, legend, north arrow, scale bar, credits; A4 / square / phone poster; light/dark) → download PNG, CSV, GeoJSON. |
| **Partnerships policy** | The Garissa County Partnerships & Coordination Policy (Aug 2025) in colour with one-click PDF download. |
| **About CSG**, **Gallery**, **Report emergency** | Mandate & structure, response scenarios; photo/map lightbox; GPS-tagged reports to emergency@garissa.go.ke. |
| **GeoAI assistant** | Gemini function-calling agent (show layers, set basemap, zoom, find assets, assets near a point, simulate flood, Tana forecast, rain outlook, disease risk, weather, open page). Works offline with a built-in rules engine when no key/server is available. |

## Architecture

```
frontend/  React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Leaflet + Recharts  → frontend/dist (static)
backend/   FastAPI: /api/forecast, /api/forecast/tana, /api/health-risk, /api/weather, /api/chat,
           /api/translate, /api/bulletin, /api/feedback, /api/updates; serves frontend/dist
scripts/   build_data.py (GIS processing → frontend/public/data/*.geojson)
           export_static_api.py (model snapshots → frontend/public/data/api/*.json for static hosting)
source_data/ copies of the Drive source layers
```

Graceful degradation: the browser tries the live Python API, then the static model snapshots, then calls
Open-Meteo directly. Auto-update: the backend refreshes weather/model output every 3 hours.

## Updating

* **New GIS data** – put files in `source_data/`, run `python scripts/build_data.py`.
* **Model changes** – edit `backend/app/forecast.py` / `health_model.py`, then `python scripts/export_static_api.py`.
* **Rebuild site** – `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`.
* **Partner logos** – drop official files at `frontend/public/logos/<id>.png` (`national-government`, `ndma`, `kenya-red-cross`, `kmd`, `unhcr`, `partners`) to replace the text badges.
